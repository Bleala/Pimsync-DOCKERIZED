## About Pimsync
**Disclaimer:** I am just the maintainer of this docker container, I did not write the software. Visit the [Official Pimsync Website](https://pimsync.whynothugo.nl/ "Official Pimsync Website") or the [Official Sourcehut Repository](https://git.sr.ht/~whynothugo/pimsync "Pimsync Sourcehut Repository") to thank the author(s)! :)

Pimsync is a command line tool to synchronise calendars and contacts between different storages, including CalDAV and CardDAV. Pimsync is a successor and reimplementation of Vdirsyncer, and is free and open source software.

Pimsync synchronises documentation across storages. Currently supported storages are:
* **CalDAV:** HTTP extension which provides read and write access to calendars on servers.
* **CardDAV:** HTTP extension which provides read and write access to address books on servers.
* **Vdir:** Convention for storing calendars and address books in local directories using standardised and well-documented formats.
* **WebCal:** Convention for exposing a calendar or event read-only using HTTP.

Common use cases include:
* Synchronising a CalDAV or CardDAV server with a local directory. Local data can then be accessed and manipulated by a variety of programs, none of which have to know or worry about synchronisation, network connectivity, or remote servers. The changes are then synced back to the server periodically.
* Synchronising from server to a local directory with the intent of keeping back-ups using a tool that backs up local directory trees.
* Synchronising data between two different CalDAV or CardDAV servers.

Pimsync is configured via a configuration file. It can then be used to synchronise data once (via the pimsync sync command) or to keep data synchronised continuously (via the pimsync daemon command).

## Image, Versions and Architecture

I built this image based on [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine "Alpine Linux Image") and compiled pimsync during the container build.

There will always be a latest image and the semantic versioning images:

| Tag | Content |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Latest    | Contains the latest stable version |
| x.x.x     | Contains the Pimsync and Alpine versions mentioned at the bottom of the page and in the release notes | 

I am using semantic versioning for this image. For all supported architectures there are the following versioned tags:

* Latest
* Major (1)
* Minor (1.0)
* Patch (1.0.0)

There are also several platforms supported:

Platforms:
* linux/amd64
* linux/arm64 
* linux/arm/v7

## Image Signing & Verification

To ensure the authenticity and integrity of my images, all `bleala/pimsync` images pushed to `Docker Hub`, `GitHub Container Registry` and `Quay.io` (and maybe more in the future) are signed using [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign "Cosign").

I use a static key pair for signing. The public key required for verification, `cosign.pub`, is available in the root of this GitHub repository:
* **Public Key:** [`cosign.pub`](https://github.com/Bleala/Pimsync-DOCKERIZED/blob/main/cosign.pub "cosign.pub")

### How to Verify an Image

You can verify the signature of an image to ensure it hasn't been tampered with and originates from me.

1.  **Install Cosign:**
    If you don't have Cosign installed, follow the official installation instructions: [Cosign Installation Guide](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/system_config/installation/ "Cosign Installation Guide").

2.  **Obtain the Public Key:**
    Download the [`cosign.pub`](https://github.com/Bleala/Pimsync-DOCKERIZED/blob/main/cosign.pub "cosign.pub") file from this repository or clone the repository to access it locally.

3.  **Verify the Image:**
    Use the `cosign verify` command. It is highly recommended to verify against the image **digest** (e.g., `sha256:...`) rather than a mutable tag (like `latest` or `1.23.0`). You can find image digests on Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry.

    ```bash
    # Ensure 'cosign.pub' is in your current directory, or provide the full path to it.
    # Replace <registry>/bleala/pimsync@sha256:<image-digest> with the actual image reference and its digest.

    # Example for an image on Docker Hub:
    cosign verify --key cosign.pub docker.io/bleala/pimsync@sha256:<ACTUAL_IMAGE_DIGEST_HERE>

    # Example for an image on GitHub Container Registry:
    cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/bleala/pimsync@sha256:<ACTUAL_IMAGE_DIGEST_HERE>
    ```

    For instance, to verify the `dev` tag with the following digest `sha256:bd9b65a3a65425bd4b67de6a61670aa0e551f996ac5f466da8aa603ab9acd005`:
    ```bash
    cosign verify --key cosign.pub docker.io/bleala/pimsync@sha256:bd9b65a3a65425bd4b67de6a61670aa0e551f996ac5f466da8aa603ab9acd005
    ```

    A successful verification will output information like this:

    ```
    cosign verify --key cosign.pub docker.io/bleala/pimsync@sha256:bd9b65a3a65425bd4b67de6a61670aa0e551f996ac5f466da8aa603ab9acd005

    Verification for index.docker.io/bleala/pimsync@sha256:bd9b65a3a65425bd4b67de6a61670aa0e551f996ac5f466da8aa603ab9acd005 --
    The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
      - The cosign claims were validated
      - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
      - The signatures were verified against the specified public key

## Usage

To start the container you can run the following

```
docker run -d -v /path/to/your/config:/pimsync/pimsync.conf \
        bleala/pimsync:latest
```

But since docker compose is easier to maintain, I'll give you a valid docker compose example.


```docker-compose.yml
networks:
  pimsync:
    driver: bridge

volumes:
  pimsync:
    name: pimsync
    driver: local

services:

      PIMSYNC_EXECUTABLE_PATH: /usr/local/bin/pimsync
      # Optional: set the Pimsync log level, default to `info`, other options are  `trace`, `debug`, `warn` or `error`
      PIMSYNC_LOG_LEVEL: info
    env_file:
      - path: .env
        required: false
    networks:
      pimsync:
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: pimsync
        target: /pimsync   
        read_only: true

        source: /path/to/pimsync.conf
        target: /pimsync/pimsync.conf
        read_only: true
```

You can start the docker-compose.yml with the following command

```
docker compose up -d
```

If you want to see the container logs, you can run

```
docker compose logs -f
```

or

```
docker logs -f pimsync
```

---

## Config

You have to mount a local configuration file inside the container to work properly. [How to config](https://pimsync.whynothugo.nl/pimsync.1.html "Pimsync configuration")

In the `/pimsnyc` folder you will also find the `pimsync.conf.example` which I copied inside the container for a quick reference.<br>
You can also find the `pimsync.conf.example` in this GitHub repository. ([Link](https://github.com/Bleala/Pimsync-DOCKERIZED/blob/main/docker/files/examples/pimsync.conf.example "pimsync.conf.example"))

The configuration file name is `pimsync.conf`. Write everything like it is shown in the docs and in my `pimsync.conf.example`!

**Attention:** It is not recommended to use `CONTAINER_MODE: auto` and `PIMSYNC_COMMAND: daemon` by default, if you have never used `Pimsync` before! If you set it to `auto` and `daemon`, it will automatically start to sync your defined storages, so don't ruin your calender/contacts structure! **Use it only if you know what you are doing! --> DYOR and [READ THE DOCS!](https://pimsync.whynothugo.nl/ "Official Documentation")**

For first time use I recommend running the container with `CONTAINER_MODE: manual`.<br>
Now you can either exec into the container with `docker exec -it pimsync sh` or run the commands directly from your host.

After the container is started and your `pimsync.conf` is mounted, I suggest that you run `docker exec -it pimsync pimsync check` to validate your config file.

Now you can discover your defined pairs with `docker exec -it pimsync pimsync discover`, to check if the connection to your configured storages does work as expected.


After you ran `docker exec -it pimsync pimsync discover` you can either run `docker exec -it pimsync pimsync sync` or, if you have not set `CONTAINER_MODE: auto` and `PIMSYNC_COMMAND: daemon`, set it to `auto`/`daemon` and restart the container with `docker compose restart` or deploy it again with `docker compose up -d`. 

Now it will sync everything for the first time.

For futher collections/pairs you do not have to run `pimsync discover` again. `Pimsync` will do this automatically in `daemon` mode. You should only do it for the first time to unterstand how `Pimsync` does work.

Everything that is done by `Pimsync` will get written to the docker logs! Run `docker logs -f pimsync` or `docker compose logs -f` to watch the logs.

**Attention:** If you would like to use the a local storage, be sure that the folder already exists, otherwise `Pimsync` produces errors!

As you can see in the [pimsync.conf.example](https://github.com/Bleala/Pimsync-DOCKERIZED/blob/main/docker/files/examples/pimsync.conf.example "pimsync.conf.example"), I set `/pimsync/calendars/` as path for the local storage and for the pair `test` as local folder. So to work properly the path/folder `/pimsync/calendars/test` has to exist before you run your first sync!<br>
Either create it with `docker exec -it pimsync "mkdir -p /path/to/your/local/folder"` (in my example this would be `docker exec -it pimsync "mkdir -p /pimsync/calendars/test"`) or if you have mounted a local folder to `/pimsync` create the subfolder and make sure, that it is readable and writable by the `pimsync` user (`UID/GID 1000`)!

---

## User

`Pimsync` does run with an user called `pimsync` inside the container and not as root.

The `UID` and `GID` for this user are `1000` by default, so be careful if you mount your `pimsync.conf`, that it is readable for this user and if you use a bind mount instead of a docker volume.

If you need to set a custom `UID` and `GID`, add the `user` key to your `docker-compose.yml`.

Example:
`user: "your_UID:your_GID"`
